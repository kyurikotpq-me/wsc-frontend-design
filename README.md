Improvements:
- Heading: Bold
- Subheading don't bold, also use a smaller font size
- Subheading use normal casing
- Switch: WRONG SIDES
- Switch: Align whole thing to center of artboard
- Tooltip: use chatbox

Also layering issues for spasskaya tower vector and the tablet vector but am unable to reproduce the problem.
